Finally asked my IT friends if they had to learn again what would they do and they said to start learning a language until you master it. Python was recommended to me.I got a new job the same time i started learning Python.Came across a situation where i would need to use the scanner on 28 pages for each client and only 7 of those were important, the other 21 were terms and conditions. So i thought maybe python could help me do a program that would insert the other 21 pages everytime i would scan pages 1,2,3,4,16,18 and 19. Used PyPDF2, this saved me so much time its insane.I was taking a online course to learn a few things but i couldnt wait to learn everything i needed to know to do this, so i started searching on my own what i could do to make this work on pdf files. My initial thought was that i would append the 7 pages into the 21 and then use some command and reorganize them. I was wrong, there was no command for that. I could however merge the pages in the order i wanted so it had the same result.Started with version 1.0, a python script that executed that page arrangement if i had a certain named file in the same directory as the script. 9 versions later now its a compiled executable that works in a 28 and 6 page file, both of them, one of them or not at all with the proper response to every situation.Another problem risen in my job, sometimes the client document would have a wrong number and i would have to fill out 2 of those 7 pages that just had the client info. I would have to write with a pen on the sheet the client NAME,ID,FISCALNUMBER,ADDRESS,CITY,POSTALCODE,CELLPHONE,EMAIL and a 20 digit number. on both pages. So again i asked the almighty Python if something could be done that would make me save time. Also asked my Boss if those values could be inputed with a computer and he said yes. So now python asks for those inputs and writes them into the pdf and i just have to print those 2 pages saving me a LOT of time.Never did find a better way to do this other than using reportlab. However the text i added was vertical in an horizontal page. I just rotated the canvas 270ยบ and its working.All of this just to say that starting to learn Python in a new job where i would need to use it to save time made me more motivated to learn it.TLDR: Total noob used a little knowledge from an online course and googling skills to get 2 programs to help him do his job faster so he can slack more time, also its my cake day, thanks for coming to my ted talk.",Discussion,Been learning Python for a month now and if you are on the fence on learning programming this post is for you.,943
