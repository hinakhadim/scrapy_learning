I have 9 jobs that require the use of a webapp in Sept and Oct.I know it can be difficult to assign a value to the help that people give here, but I can safely say that over the next two months, the app that I got help building last year, will save me enough money to make a mortgage payment! But it gets better, instead of sitting here waiting for uploads and downloads to and from the webapp to finish, I'm gaining hours of time with my family.Thank you to everyone that helps their fellow redditers here, and especially thanks to the people that helped me last year.",Meta,Big thank you to the community here!,143

41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/x8ag01/int1_4301_will_raise_valueerror_starting_with/,"tl;dr (from ):Converting between int and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises a ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity. This is a mitigation for CVE-2020-10735. This limit can be configured or disabled by environment variable, command line flag, or sys APIs. See the integer string conversion length limitation documentation. The default limit is 4300 digits in string form.3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14 will also get this fix: More details: ",News,`int('1' * 4301)` will raise ValueError starting with Python 3.10.7,128
